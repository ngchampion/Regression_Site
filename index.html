  <h1><center>Linear Regression</center></h1>
  <p>
    Linear Regression is a type of predictive statistical analysis. It will take an independant compare it to a dependant variable and predict future dependant variables based
    on the independant variable. If the prediction is accurate then there could be a causal relationship between the two variables.

    This is a scatter plot. Graphs like this are used as a visual representation of the dependant and independant variable and the predictive line linear regression creates. This
    predictive line is also referred to as the line of best fit. This line is calculated by the following formula.

    The variables 'm' and 'b' are input into a basic line formula of y = m x + b. <br><br>
    As you can see from the scatter plot above the line follows the trend of the points on the graph but it does not perfectly predict them. We can calculate the standard error 
    to find out how far off on average each point is. This number will tell us generally how accurate our line of best fit is mathmatically. The final useful statistic for 
    calculating linear regression is a term called R squared. The standard error will tell us how much correlation there is between the independant and dependant variable whereas 
    the R squared variable will provide a percentage output of how well the line of best fits works with the dependant values.
